# Overview

`dugite` is a wrapper on top of the Git command line interface, with some helpers to make it easy to consume in your Node applications. The important parts:

- `GitProcess` - the core of the library - `GitProcess.exec` is how you
  interact with Git
- `IGitResult` - the abstraction for a result returned by Git - contains
  exit code and standard output/error text
- `IGitExecutionOptions` - additional overrides to change the behaviour
  of `GitProcess` (see [API extensibility](./api-extensibility.md) for
  more information)
- `GitError` - a collection of known error codes that `dugite` can understand
